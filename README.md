# GoLang

Go or Golang is a general purpose programming language which emphasis simplicity developed in google in 2007.
Go is a strong and statically typed language.

Strong typing means that the type of a variable cannot change over time,
for example, when a variable is decleared to be an integer(int) it must and will always hold an integer, it cannot hold a string.
Static typing means that all variable types are checked at compile time, before run time. The programmer must explicitly indicated by the programmer.

Go is also a compiled language, this simply means that all the codes written by the programmer are compiled by the go compiler into machine code, this machine code is easier and faster for the computer to understand.

Go has concurrency built into it, concurrency simply is the ability of a program to run different parts or tasks at the same time.This is not to be confused with parallelism which allows for two or more tasks to be executed simultaneously.
